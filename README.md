# Machine Learning and Data Science from scratch
Codeing examples and references for mentoring Data Science and ML from the ground up.

Content is for instructive purposes only. I highly recommend using packages and tools available to for download (import) instead of expanind on the examples show here. As a new Data Scientist or ML engineer, there is value in understanding the principles and mechanics behind these concepts. 

Example code is intended to be used in combination with mentoring and reference documentation. It is not intedend to be complete courses. Reference Coursera or Stanford University for online instruction.
