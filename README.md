# Machine Learning and Data Science from scratch
Coding examples and references for anyone wanting to get started in Data Science and ML.

Content is intended instructive purposes only and for use in combination with mentoring or use as a reference. Crash Courses provide enough skills for a novice to begin working on projects and do not exhaustively cover each topic. I can recommend books, courses, links or names of people to follow if you wish a deeper understanding of the subject. For projects, I highly recommend using packages and tools available for download (import) instead of expanding on examples shown here. 

All software is written and tested using Python 3.7 however it should be compatible with 3.6 and 3.8.

You should begin with the Python Crash Course (PCC) to before proceeding to Linear Algebra Crash Course (LACC) if you need to refresh this skill.

## PCC - Python Crash Course
While there are many languages that are excellent for machine learning and Data Science, I have found that Python has the shortest learning curve and is used as a general purpose programming language useful for developing applications on any device using any OS.

This Crash Course is focused on Python programming fundamentals for Data Science and Machine Learning only and is not an exhaustive discussion.

## LACC - Linear Algebra Crash Course
Introduction to Linear Algebra using Python. Examples and knowledge from this course is used in the Python Crash Course as well as others.

## SCC - Statistics Crash Course
Introduction to Statistics using Python. Example uses are in data preprocessing and data visulation.

## NPCC - NumPy Crash Course
Introduction to the Data Pre-processing module NumPY which is used for numeric processing. You can use NumPy and the examples in this course for data science projects in place of previous Crash Course examples such as the Linear Algebra Crash Course or Matrix Math functions.

## MPLCC - Matplotlib Crash Course
Brief introduction of Matplotlib. Examples of how to create line, bar and scatter charts along with adding colors, legends and labeling axes.

## PDCC - Pandas Crash Course
Pandas introduction and reference code. Pandas is an important Data pre-processing tool for Data Science.
