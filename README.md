# Machine Learning and Data Science from scratch
Codeing examples and references for mentoring Data Science and ML from the ground up.

Content is for instructive purposes only. I highly recommend using packages and tools available to for download (import) instead of expanding on the examples shown here. As a new Data Scientist or ML engineer, there is value in understanding the principles and mechanics behind these concepts. 

Example code is intended to be used in combination with mentoring and reference documentation. It is not intedend to be complete courses. Reference Coursera or Stanford University for online instruction.

Software is written for Python 3.7. While it should be compatible with 3.6 and 3.8, I haven't performed regression tests on this code.

## Python Crash Course - PCC
While there are many languages that are excellent for machine learning and Data Science, I have found that Python has the shortest learning curve and is used as a general purpose programming language that is useful for developing applications on any device using any OS.

This Crash Course is focused on Python and programming fundamentals for Data Science and Machine Learning only and is not an exhaustive discussion on Python. It also contains programming examples and reference code using Python intended for use with verbal instruction.

## NPCC - NumPy Crash Course
Introduction to the Data Pre-processing module NumPY which is used for numeric processing. Use this module for you data science projects in place of any Crash Course software such as the Linear Algebra Crash Course or Matrix Math functions.
